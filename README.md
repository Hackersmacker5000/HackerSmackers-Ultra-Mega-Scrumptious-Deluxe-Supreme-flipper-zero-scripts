You’ll find Flipper Zero codes here — mostly generated by ChatGPT and my two brain cells.
Low-effort scripts, experiments, and dumb little tools. Use at your own risk.
Don’t be stupid. This stuff isn’t super dangerous, but read the code before running anything. Sandbox it if you care about your device.
This is my first finger-dip into GitHub — chaotic, half-finished, and honest.
PRs welcome if you actually know what you’re doing.
